I am someone who **loves** to learn, read and write. <br> Often doing both all of those things too late into the night. Tea is essential to my survival as is the occasional early night to play catch up. 
I like to try to start my day writing at least _three_ morning pages, while sipping on tea and enjoying the quiet as it settles in after the morning school rush. 
I am quiet and introverted but **_firey and passionate_** about things that are important to me.
